# Lesson 5
### How to execute an external command
 Type :! followed by an external command to execute that command. (like :!ls to listing your directory) <br>
NOTE:  All  :  commands must be finished by hitting <ENTER>.

1. To save changes made to the text, type :w FILENAME.
2. To delete the file type :!rm FILENAME.

### Selecting text to write
1. To save part of the file, type v motion :w FILENAME
2. v motion will highlight the text.
3. When you press : at the bottom will appear :'<,'>
4. Type w TEST (test is a filename that doesn't exist yet)
5. Vim will write the selected lines to the file TEST.

NOTE:  Pressing  v  starts Visual selection.  You can move the cursor around to make the selection bigger or smaller.  Then you can use an operator to do something with the text.  For example,  d  deletes the text.

### Retrieving and merging files
* You can retrieve TEST file using the commnad :r TEST (test is the filename) -> the file you retrieve is placed below the cursor line.

NOTE:  You can also read the output of an external command.  For example,
       :r !ls  reads the output of the ls command and puts it below the
       cursor.

# Lesson 6
### The open command
1. Type o (lowerCase) to open a line below the cursor and place you in Insert mode.
2. Type O (upperCase) to open a line above the cursor and place you in Insert mode.

### The append command
1. Type a to insert text after the cursor.
2. Move with e or w to where you want to append text, and then type a.

NOTE:  a, i and A all go to the same Insert mode, the only difference is where the characters are inserted.

### Another way to replace
* Type a capital  R  to replace more than one character.
NOTE:  Replace mode is like Insert mode, but every typed character deletes an existing character (until ESC is pressed).

### Copy and Paste operator
1. Use the y to copy and p to paste.
2. Move the cursor to the end of the next line:  j$
3. Type  p  to put (paste) the text. <br>
NOTE: you can also use  y  as an operator;  yw  copy one word.

### Set option
1. Set an option so a search or substitute ignores case.
2. press /AWord ->press n to look for it several times.
3. Set the ic (ignore case)   :set ic... search for /AWord.
4. :set hls is -> highlight all the searched words.
5. To disable ignoring case enter  :set noic
6. To remove the highlighting of matches enter:
:nohlsearch <br>
NOTE:  If you want to ignore case for just one search command, use  \c
             in the phrase:  /ignore\c  <ENTER>

* Typing ":set xxx" sets the option "xxx".  Some options are:
        'ic' 'ignorecase'       ignore upper/lower case when searching
        'is' 'incsearch'        show partial matches for a search phrase
        'hls' 'hlsearch'        highlight all matching phrases
     You can either use the long or the short option name.

# Lesson 7
### Getting Help
on-line help system
* Enter \<F1>
* :help <ENTER>
* :help cmd to find help on cmd

1. Type CTRL-W CTRL-W to jump from one window to another

### Create a startup script
Enable VIM features
* To use more features you have to create a "vimrc" file.
:e ~/.vimrc
Create a vimrc startup script to keep your preferred settings.

### Completion
Command line completion with CTRL-D and <TAB>
1. Make sure Vim is not in compatible mode:  :set nocp

When typing a  :  command, press CTRL-D to see possible completions. Press <TAB> to use one completion.

NOTE:  Completion works for many commands.  Just try pressing CTRL-D and <TAB>.  It is especially useful for  :help .
